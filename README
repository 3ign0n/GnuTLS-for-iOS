This is a tutorial for using self-compiled builds of the GnuTLS-library for iOS. You can build apps with XCode and the official SDK from Apple with this. I also made a small example-app for using the libraries with XCode and the iPhone/iPhone-Simulator. You can also download the precompiled GnuTLS-library (2.10.4).

Enjoy GnuTLS on the iPhone!

I have made an iOS 4.2 XCode Project with GnuTLS 2.10.4 Libaries. The examples uses the MD5-algorithm to calculate an md5 from an UITextfield.

UPDATE 01.02.2011: Updated GnuTLS to 2.10.4: Patch needed from http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/4825
